Predict insurance cost using Linear Regression

In this project, we have a dataset of insurance costs of 1338 individuals along with their information like sex, age, bmi, smoking status and region.

The goal of this project is to use this data to train a logistic regression model that can predict the insurance of any individual provided the age, bmi and smoking status of the individual.

The algorithm going to be used for this project is Linear Regression since that is the most suitable for this kind of problems.
